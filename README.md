## Hello there 👋📢
I'm Stratos and I am a software engineer with a focus on machine learning. I like to design and develop artificial intelligence applications based on practical goals. Having participated in all stages of the product development process - and solving business needs in a variety of programming tools - I am a firm believer of the language-agnostic software paradigm.

🌱 I’m currently applying Python - and many of its frameworks/libraries - on the following interdisciplinary fields:
- Automation
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
